# goblinfriends3d

Goblin Friends 3D is a work-in-progress game. When done, you will be able venture into deep dark dungeons, meet goblins, and befriend them (or not). Friendship is its own reward, but rumor has it that the powerful Staff of Nerual is somewhere in its deepest reaches. Maybe your new (maybe) friends will help?

## Installing

As long as you have the most recent version of Unity, you should be able to open the project without any trouble.

## Playing

Use arrow keys to move around. Press "i" to view your inventory, and from there you can drag and drop items to throw them or equip them! When weilding the bow, press "f" to toggle fire mode. When in fire mode, click on your target! Walk into mushrooms to chop them down, and click downed mushrooms to pick them up. Use space + direction to jump. Jumping is a fun thing to do when you are with friends.

## Known Issues

- There is sometimes a crash when two goblins attempt to eat the same mushroom at the same time.
- Pathfinding doesn't differentiate between houses in Goblin Towne, so when a goblin decides to go home it goes to the nearest house. In practice, this means all goblins tend to try desperately to cram into the same tiny house.
- There is sometimes a crash during map generation when a cave gets generated next to the map edge.

## TODO

- Dialogue system!
- More detailed goblin interactions, including quests
- Monsters which are not goblins; these monsters may not be quite as eager to be friends. Sometimes, they will be terrorizing Goblin Towne; slaying these beasts or otherwise getting them to stop attacking goblins may be a good way to make goblins like you more.
- Multiple levels. (probably connected by portals?)
- More items!
